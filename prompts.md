<!-- Version 1.0 - Created prompt log for Codex updates. -->
## 1. Add examples to methods wizard
**Prompt:** we are going to update methods.html which is built based on the knowledge is researchmethods.md file.   However, let's not change methods.html, let's create a new file called methods2x.html and put all changes there.  The update is to add examples for each of the selections.  For example, in the initial screen there is a choice that says "explain relationships..." with a description underneath.  We would add something like "Example: Explore the relationship between incentive programs and productivity in retail environments."  Look for appropriate examples from the source material or from a web search.  The example needs to be a single sentence.  We need examples for all the choices in all the screens.
**Response (Codex):**
- Created methods2x.html as a copy of methods.html with an updated version comment and added CSS styling for example callouts.
- Inserted tailored single-sentence examples for every decision option using content inspired by researchmethods.md to guide users.
- Recorded this activity in prompts.md for future context tracking.
