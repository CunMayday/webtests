# Introduction

This overview provides a brief summary of research methodologies for conducting applied research.

# Part I: Quantitative Research Methodologies

## #1: Experimental Research Designs

Experimental research represents the gold standard for establishing causal relationships in business research through deliberate manipulation of variables while controlling for confounding factors. For DBA students, experimental designs are particularly valuable when testing the effectiveness of business interventions, strategies, or policies.

Core experimental approaches include true experiments with random assignment, quasi-experiments without randomization, and field experiments conducted in natural business settings. The strength of experimental designs lies in their ability to establish causation rather than mere correlation, making them ideal for evaluating business initiatives and strategic decisions.

**True experiments** require random assignment of participants to treatment and control groups, providing the strongest evidence for causal relationships. In business contexts, this might involve randomly assigning employees to different training programs or customers to different service approaches. However, practical constraints often necessitate quasi-experimental designs, which maintain comparison groups and variable manipulation but lack random assignment.

**Field experiments** offer a compelling middle ground, conducting controlled studies within actual business environments. These designs maintain experimental rigor while enhancing external validity through real-world implementation. For example, a DBA student might test different leadership communication strategies across departments, measuring their impact on employee engagement and performance.

Implementation considerations for DBA students include securing organizational support, ensuring adequate sample sizes through power analysis, and addressing ethical considerations when manipulating business processes. Typical business experiments require 30-50 participants per group for basic comparisons, with complex designs requiring 100+ participants per condition.

Real-world applications demonstrate experimental design effectiveness in business research. Studies examining the impact of flexible work arrangements on productivity, testing different customer service approaches, or evaluating the effectiveness of management training programs all benefit from experimental methodologies that can establish causal relationships between interventions and outcomes.
